    <h3 class="text-2xl">The Job Seekers Journey</h3>
    <p class="my-4">A spin on the <a href="#recruitment" class="text-lg hover:text-colOne font-bold">Recruitment Funnel</a> this platform is just a place to track 
        all of the jobs that you've applied for. We're able to apply for jobs using a number 
        of platforms, sometimes the same job can be found on different platforms, allowing 
        you to track all of you applications from a single place. But often, this is not the 
        case. We're asked to use LinkedIn, sometimes a job searching site like Indeed 
        and often both of those resources simply take us to the company website directly.</p>
        <p class="my-4"> 
        This means that tracking all of your applications in a single place is not always 
        possible. So we're offering you the chance to track all of your job applications 
        in a single place. </p>

    <p class="my-4">We're not listing jobs, we're not acting as a recruitment agent (therefore we're not going to apply for jobs on your behalf) 
        we're just giving you a single place that allows you to record as many details as you 
        wish about the jobs that you're interested in.
