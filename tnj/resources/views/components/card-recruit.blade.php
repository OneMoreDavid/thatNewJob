    <h3 class="text-2xl" id="recruitment">The Recruitment Funnel</h3>
    <p class="my-4">As a job seeker, it can feel like getting a new job is all about trying to 
        convince someone to take a chance on you, espeically if you're new to the field. 
        In fact, finding the right candidates can be enourmously difficult and 
        expensive for an employer. This is why any job seeker coaching or 
        interview coaching you may have access to will focus on how you bring value to 
        the employer, not what the employer can do for you. That said, often just 
        getting the interview can be the trickiest part of the job seekers journey.
        The <b>Recruitment Funnel</b> is a spin on the Conversion Funnel in that the 
        recruiter is trying to sell the organisation or the team within an organisation. 
        Much like the Conversion Funnel, you start with a wide net, you want as many applicants 
        as possible, gradually reducing the number of potential candidates down to a number 
        that you think will make it through to offer.</p>

        It starts with listing the job, using the places that are known to generate a 
        lot of leads. Once those applications start rolling in, you need to prioritise the 
        time your human workforce is spending on this activity, therefore the use of tools 
        to help automate things like <b>CV scanning</b> equate to using low cost 
        (relatively speaking) tools which is why a job seeker rarely gets a personalised 
        response to their application. The system automated your rejection and is unable to 
        offer any feedback of great value at this stage. Much like the Conversion Funnel 
        the aim is to whittle down the potential number of applicants down to a number 
        that is more manageable at the interview stage, with the best of the interviewees 
        receiving a job offer.
