    <p class="my-4">You have the ability to Track a job. This involves adding as many or as few 
        details as you like. The data you add is visible to you alone, so how much you share 
        is entirely up to you. As the original creator, I use the platform to record the 
        following details: </p>

        I keep all this data for a few reasons, the primary reason is that I think this stuff helps with interview 
        preperation and I am interested in seeing what the data will look like (future functionality) 
        Number of applications before successful hire, and time an item is at each stage etc.
