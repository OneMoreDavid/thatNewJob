    <h3 class="text-2xl" id="conversion">The Conversion Funnel</h3>
    <p class="my-4">The <b>Conversion Funnel</b> starts with building product or brand awareness, using a wide net to generate as many potential leads as possible. 
        This could be through advertising or casting a drag net over LinkedIn profiles.

        The idea is to whittle down the potential customers through 
        to a number that will actually buy, usually involving a cheaper workforce or 
        cheaper tooling at the start before unleashing your top earning sales folk 
        for that final push through to procurement.
